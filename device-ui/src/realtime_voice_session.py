"""
OpenAI Realtime voice bridge for the MeetingBox device UI.

Minimal, low-latency rebuild.

Design:
- Connect to wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime with the ephemeral
  client_secret minted by the MeetingBox server.
- Trust the server's semantic_vad for turn detection — server runs with
  `create_response: true` and `interrupt_response: true`, so end-of-turn
  and barge-in are handled at the source instead of being gated on a
  second model hop (transcription + manual response.create on the
  client). This removes ~0.5–1.5 s of dead air per turn.
- Send ONE small session.update: nudge eagerness to "high" and enable
  user-audio transcription (used only for farewell detection). The
  server's full instructions, tools, voice, and audio format are left
  exactly as configured.
- Stream PCM16 mic audio at 24 kHz to input_audio_buffer.append.
- Play model audio deltas through aplay; pipe writes run on a dedicated
  single-thread executor so they never block the WebSocket heartbeat.
- On user speech_started: hard-kill aplay so the user hears themselves,
  not the assistant. The server will cancel the in-flight response on
  its own via interrupt_response.
- On user transcript completion: if the text is a farewell, close the
  session. Otherwise the server creates the next response automatically.
- On function-call output in response.done: invoke the backend tool via
  HTTP, post the result back, send response.create to continue.

Echo / self-hearing handling depends on the resolved audio hardware:
- Echo-isolated combined external mic+speaker puck (AudioDevicePair
  is_combined): full-duplex. Speex AEC + an energy-based barge-in gate
  let the user talk over the assistant.
- Built-in mic + speaker (chassis-coupled) or any non-combined pair
  (e.g. external mic + built-in speaker): half-duplex. While the assistant
  speaks (plus an echo-decay tail) mic frames are gated: with Speex AEC
  active, only frames clearly louder than the speaker echo pass through so
  the user can still talk over the assistant (energy-gated voice barge-in,
  with a larger margin than full-duplex to reject the heavier coupling);
  without AEC the uplink is fully muted and only screen-tap barge-in works.
Override with REALTIME_HALF_DUPLEX (auto|1|0).

# Full-duplex uses an echo-isolated puck, so a modest margin suffices.
