"""
OpenAI Realtime voice bridge for the MeetingBox device UI.

Minimal, low-latency rebuild.

Design:
- Connect to wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime with the ephemeral
  client_secret minted by the MeetingBox server.
- Trust the server's semantic_vad for turn detection — server runs with
  `create_response: true` and `interrupt_response: true`, so end-of-turn
  and barge-in are handled at the source instead of being gated on a
  second model hop (transcription + manual response.create on the
  client). This removes ~0.5–1.5 s of dead air per turn.
- Send ONE small session.update: nudge eagerness to "high" and enable
  user-audio transcription (used only for farewell detection). The
  server's full instructions, tools, voice, and audio format are left
  exactly as configured.
- Stream PCM16 mic audio at 24 kHz to input_audio_buffer.append.
- Play model audio deltas through aplay; pipe writes run on a dedicated
  single-thread executor so they never block the WebSocket heartbeat.
- On user speech_started: hard-kill aplay so the user hears themselves,
  not the assistant. The server will cancel the in-flight response on
  its own via interrupt_response.
- On user transcript completion: if the text is a farewell, close the
  session. Otherwise the server creates the next response automatically.
- On function-call output in response.done: invoke the backend tool via
  HTTP, post the result back, send response.create to continue.

No acoustic echo cancellation, no transcript-based echo guard, no
deferred barge-in. With an external mic+speaker, the previous
self-interruption loop does not occur.
