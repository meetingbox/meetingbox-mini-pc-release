"""
OpenAI Realtime voice bridge for the MeetingBox device UI.

Minimal, low-latency rebuild.

Design:
- Connect to wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime with the ephemeral
  client_secret minted by the MeetingBox server.
- Server VAD segments turns; the CLIENT decides what happens to them
  (client-authority turn-taking). The session runs with
  `create_response: false` and `interrupt_response: false`: at
  input_audio_buffer.committed the client checks the turn's acoustic
  evidence and either sends response.create (genuine speech) or
  conversation.item.delete (phantom — echo/noise the server VAD
  mis-segmented). A phantom therefore never creates a response, never
  paints a bubble, and never pollutes the model's context. Latency cost
  is one WS message (~no dead air); the evidence is already computed by
  the time the commit event arrives.
- Send ONE small session.update: nudge eagerness to "high" and enable
  user-audio transcription (used only for farewell detection). The
  server's full instructions, tools, voice, and audio format are left
  exactly as configured.
- Stream PCM16 mic audio at 24 kHz to input_audio_buffer.append.
- Play model audio deltas through aplay; pipe writes run on a dedicated
  single-thread executor so they never block the WebSocket heartbeat.
- On user speech_started with local speech evidence: hard-kill aplay so
  the user hears themselves, not the assistant, and send response.cancel
  (the client owns interruption — interrupt_response is off so a VAD
  false-positive can never truncate a genuine answer).
- On user transcript completion: if the text is a farewell, close the
  session. Otherwise the server creates the next response automatically.
- On function-call output in response.done: invoke the backend tool via
  HTTP, post the result back, send response.create to continue.

Turn speech-evidence layer (engine-agnostic, all paths):
- Every frame sent up the wire is scored by a local VAD (adaptive noise
  floor + WebRTC APM speech probability when AEC3 is live) at the single
  uplink choke point. Final transcripts are accepted only when the turn's
  audio actually carried speech — otherwise they are ASR hallucinations
  ("it" / "hello" / ".") from a noise-committed turn and are dropped, with
  the auto-created response cancelled. The same evidence gates barge-in: a
  server speech_started only stops playback when the uplink recently
  carried locally-verified speech. See _UplinkSpeechMonitor.
- Echo-aware scoring: while assistant audio plays (plus a decay hangover)
  the AEC's residual echo is both energetic and voice-like, so RMS vs the
  ambient floor cannot arbitrate. Playback-time frames must instead reach
  an absolute barge-in level AND dominate a learned residual-echo envelope
  (the double-talk principle) before they count as speech evidence. This
  stops the assistant's own leaked voice from validating phantom turns
  ("The" / "Hi") or authorizing false self-interruptions.

Echo / self-hearing handling depends on the resolved audio hardware:
- Echo-isolated combined external mic+speaker puck (AudioDevicePair
  is_combined): full-duplex. Speex AEC + an energy-based barge-in gate
  let the user talk over the assistant.
- Built-in mic + speaker (chassis-coupled) or any non-combined pair:
  half-duplex. While the assistant speaks (plus an echo-decay tail) ALL
  mic frames are dropped so the device never hears its own voice and
  loops; voice barge-in is off but screen-tap barge-in still works.
Override with REALTIME_HALF_DUPLEX (auto|1|0).

# the server hears silence, and it closes the session on a keepalive timeout
# (observed repeatedly during continuous email dictation on a ~0.4-1.1 Mbps
# link). G.711 mu-law at 8 kHz is ~64 kbps (~6x smaller after base64) — the
# standard low-bandwidth voice codec (telephone quality) — and fits in even a
# marginal upstream with headroom. The DOWNLINK (assistant voice) is

# --- Dead-link (half-open connection) detection ---------------------------
# A flaky uplink can lose its INBOUND half while the outbound half stays up:
# TCP keeps ACKing our audio (frames flow, sends are fast) but OpenAI's events
# never arrive. The WS ping/pong CANNOT catch this quickly — OpenAI legitimately
# delays protocol pongs 5-15 s+ while generating, which is why ping_timeout had
# to be raised to 120 s (a shorter timeout false-closed healthy mid-response
# sessions). So a dead inbound link previously sat undetected for ~60 s until the
# network itself reaped the zombie socket, stranding the user mid-conversation.
#
# The correct liveness signal is INBOUND DATA FLOW, not pings: a live-but-busy
# server streams audio/transcription deltas continuously (sub-second), so
# "time since the last server event" stays fresh; only a truly dead link goes
# fully silent. We flag the link dead when we have been actively streaming mic
# audio (so the server owes us SOMETHING — at minimum a speech_started) yet have
# received nothing for this long. Guarded so a legitimate long dictation (server
# already acked speech_started; a single utterance emits no further events until
# speech_stopped) is never mistaken for a dead link — except past the hard cap,
# which catches a link that dies mid-utterance so speech_stopped never comes.

# Inbound silence alone is NOT proof of a dead link: a silent user produces the
# exact same signature (uplink trickling frames, server with nothing to say).
# So when a silence threshold trips, VERIFY with a protocol ping before killing
# the session — a healthy idle link pongs in well under a second; only a truly
# dead link stays mute.
#
# A live link pongs in <1s, so a 10s wait for a pong that is never coming was
# pure dead air: it turned a brief inbound half-open blip into ~20s of silence
# before we even started recovering. Instead we probe FAST but require TWO
# consecutive unanswered pings to declare death — the second ping absorbs a
# single delayed pong under momentary load, so we are both quick (~4s worst

# session that clock stalls and the DSP stops delivering frames, so the mic goes
# permanently deaf (observed: peak_rms collapses to ~48, then 60 s+ of zero
# frames, then the realtime socket closes on a 90 s server-silence timeout).

    Observes every frame at the uplink choke point (post-AEC, post-gates) and
    scores it against an adaptive ambient-noise floor, optionally refined by
    the WebRTC APM's spectral speech probability. The per-frame decisions are
    retained in a short rolling window so the session can ask two questions
    with real acoustic ground truth:

      * ``stats_since(ts)`` — how much speech-like audio did the current turn
        actually carry? Used to validate final transcripts: a committed turn
        with (near-)zero speech evidence cannot have produced a genuine
        transcript, so whatever text the ASR returned is a hallucination.
      * ``recent_speech(window)`` — did the uplink carry speech-like audio in
        the immediate past? Used to gate interruptions: a server
        ``speech_started`` that no locally-observed speech can explain is an
        echo/noise artifact and must not stop playback.

    Echo awareness: RMS against the ambient floor is meaningless while the
    assistant's own audio is playing — residual echo that survives the AEC is
    energetic AND spectrally speech-like (it IS a voice: the assistant's).
    Frames observed during playback (plus a decay hangover) therefore face a
    dedicated bar: they must reach an absolute barge-in level and dominate a
    separately-learned residual-echo envelope. This is the double-talk
    principle: only near-end audio that overpowers the echo path counts.

    Engine-agnostic by design: identical behavior on the OS-DSP, AEC3, Speex
    and raw-mic paths, while the assistant is speaking and while it is idle.
    Single-threaded (asyncio loop) — no locking needed.
